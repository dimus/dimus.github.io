Github is actively supporting science in [several ways][githubsci]. Open sourced
code is becoming more and more acceptable as a publication, and it is becoming
important to have a stable reference to programs you write. [Github][github] and
[Zenodo][zenodo] allow you to make it happen! You can find information how do
do it on a [Github help page][doigen].
