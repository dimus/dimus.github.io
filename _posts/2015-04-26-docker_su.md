I talked with [pleary][1] yesterday and he mentioned his blog for which he uses
jekyll and [github pages][2]. I liked the idea so now I am plaing with one
myself. So I follwed [instructions][2], grabbed a [template][3] and now I am
all set to write my first blog about making my first blog.

I use markdown for many years, but Jekyll is something I did not play with
before. Lets see how it goes.  I figured out that posts are located in _posts
directory -- so far so good. I opened an example from template and found this
kind of metadata there:

    ---
    layout: post
    tags: jekyll
    date: 2015-04-26 09:16
    thumbnail: http://placehold.it/100x100
    title: Date for jekyll metadata
    published: true

Entering date by hand is too much work, so  I made a small shell script `bdate`
to help me:

```ruby
#!/bin/sh

echo `date  +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`
```

My editor of choice is Vim, and now I can just use

    :r !bdate

Another thing I found useful is `gqip` shorcut that reformats paragraphs
for me and wraps them neatly at 80 columns. However when I looked at my first post I found that my text wraps at every new line I inserted! Definitely not what I want. After reading about [kramdown options][4] i found how to change this behavior:

```yaml
markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  hard_wrap: false
  input: GFM
```
