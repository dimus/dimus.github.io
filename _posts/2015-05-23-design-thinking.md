I am listening the book while driving or biking and trying to grab nuggets of
whisdom in this blog. I am writing it day by day, putting down ideas that
resonated with me and thoughts that they broght out.


Design is about telling the story
---------------------------------

**Story telling through design is how design solves problems**

Design in 21th century different from 20th
------------------------------------------

Design of the 20th century was about creating a new form for existing tools.
In 21st century the main feature of life is change. The design is about
going along with the changing world, and creating tools, cultures, behaviors
to meet new challenges and opportunities.


Design with human in the center
-------------------------------

* Design is about spotting human needs and creating new demands which reflect
  these needs

* People do not know their needs more often than not. So the way to discover
  the needs you watch people struggle and go around the problems, hear what
  they say and what they do not say.

* Designer goes into the wild and studies people from inside of their
  environment. It is important not only to look at the middle of the Gaussian
  curve, but also at edge cases, as edge cases often amplify needs of the
  middle.  For example a 6 year old girl struggling with a can opener shows
  where the can-opener lacks.


Design with people
------------------

There are 5 ways to design, #4 is what book recomments, discarding #5 as not
proven to bring good results (open design)

1. Design against people
2. Design isolated from people
3. Design for people
4. **Design with people**
5. Assist people to do design


Design is not about improving existing, it is about creating nonexisting
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When people design they are not (necessary) discovering something that exists
already and waits to be discovered. They are creating something new that did
not exist already, or at least such cases create the most important and game
changing solutions.

Design as a communal effort
---------------------------

* These days design is not done by designers only, it is most efficient when
  it is done by people from manty different views. The best designs come from
  teams which include people form different professions

* Original idea is best when done by smallish team. After that team will grow
  according to the scale of the idea.

* To create design-friendly environment people need to be freed from the
  confinements of standard corporate approach and ethics. They need to be moved
  psychologically as close to what they are as possible. Bewave about what will
  happen with people when they move back to their jobs later. They might not
  want to be what they had been anymore.
