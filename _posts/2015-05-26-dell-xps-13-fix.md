title: Dell 13" XPS 9343 BIOS A04 Keyboard Fix
published: true
---

There is new release or BIOS for XPS 13 9343 laptop. It did not fix
repeating keystrokes problem for me, but I did learn a few things in the
process of installing the firmware update.

Upgrading to BIOS A04
---------------------

### Download A04

go to [download page][a04]

then apparently there are 2 ways to proceed

1. Put file into /boot/efi and reboot
2. make a USB stick.

### Make a USB stick

* Download [FreeDOS USB image][freedos]. I picked 256M version.

* Use gparted to create fat32 partition on your usb

* Use (kinda buggy) Setup Disk Creator to create FAT32 boot from the
  downloaded ISO file

* Insert USB stick and reboot machine

* Press F2 when Dell logo showes up to get to setup mode

* In Boot options pick legacy and USB stick. Apply, Exit

* Boot the disk, type to boot freedos, pick 4th option (no drivers), and
  execute the firmware update command.

* Follow instructions

Unfortunatelly these steps did not save me from repeated keystrokes as
I said.
