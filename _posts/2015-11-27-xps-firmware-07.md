title: Dell 13" XPS 9343 BIOS A07 Keyboard Fix
published: true
---

There is new release or BIOS for [XPS 13 9343 laptop][xps13]. Finally no
repeating keystrokes apparently! I am so tired of these and so happy to be able
to have only typos I get from my own fingers :)

Upgrading to BIOS A07 on Ubuntu
-------------------------------

* Go to [download page][a07] and download the sucker
* With sudo put it to /boot/efi dir
* Restart and press F12 to get to upgrade window
* Follow Instructions to Upgrade your BIOS firmware

And here we go -- typing is back to normal AT LAST.
